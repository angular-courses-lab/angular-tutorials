You've just learned how to delete a task from the list, now you want to display a message when the list is empty.

## The @if Control Flow syntax

To iterate over the task list, you used `@for` from the Control Flow feature.

Another feature from the Control Flow is the `@if` directive.
It allows you to condition the display of an element in the view.

By giving it a condition, the element is only displayed if the condition is true.

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-list.html`.

   ```html ins={"Display a message when the list is empty by adding following at the end of your html": 3-6}
    // task-list.html


     @if (!tasks().length) {
     <p class="my-5 text-center">No tasks</p>
     }
   ```

</Steps>

## Let's test it!

<Steps>
1. Delete all tasks from the list.
2. The message "No tasks" should appear.

</Steps>
