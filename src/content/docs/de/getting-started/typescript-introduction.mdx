## What is TypeScript?

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is purely object-oriented with classes, interfaces and is statically typed like C# or Java.

## Why use TypeScript?

Using TypeScript offers several advantages:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides static typing, which helps you catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This can help you detect bugs earlier and improve your code quality.
- **Tools**: TypeScript provides a rich set of tools for building and maintaining large-scale applications. This includes features such as code completion and easier refactoring.
- **Readability**: TypeScript provides a way to add type annotations to your code, which can make it easier to understand and maintain.

Take a **car** object, in Javascript, we accept the following format:

```javascript
const car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2020,
};
```

To log the car's model, you would do:

```javascript
console.log(car.model);
```

But not only do you have to remember the car object's structure, you also need to remember the type of each property.
This makes code maintenance and understanding more complicated. If you happened to make a typo like `modle` instead of `model`, you won't get any warning from your IDE but your code will break at runtime in users's browser.

In TypeScript, you can define a **Car** interface like this:

```typescript
export interface Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
}
```

A type is a set of elements that allow us to categorize information.
In this example, not only do we bind different characteristics of a car like its model or manufacturer, but we also define the actual type of each property.
We will therefore handle strings for the model and manufacturer but a number for the year.

Compared to our last snippet, you can now add the type `Car` to your variable declaration, after the variable name.

```typescript ins=": Car"
const car: Car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2020,
};
```

<NotificationCard state="info" title="TypeScript creation format">
The TypeScript creation format is composed as follows:

```typescript
<property>: <type> = <value>;
```

`[]` is used to define an array, as in `tasks: Task[]`.

## What are the benefits of using TypeScript?

- **Auto-completion**: When you define a type for a variable, you get auto-completion for that type's properties.

- **Type checking**: TypeScript will check if you're using the correct type for a variable.

- **IDE Support**: Your IDE will warn you if you use the wrong type for a variable.

- **Compilation Errors**: TypeScript will detect errors at compile time.

<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  In this chapter, you learned how to create your first TypeScript model. You
  learned how to define a TypeScript interface and use it to create a new
  object.

There are some advanced usages not covered in this course, like generic types, enums, and more.
Besides adding types, most of your code written in TypeScript will be valid JavaScript code.
