## What is Angular?

> Angular is a web framework that enables developers to create fast and reliable applications.
> Managed by a dedicated team at Google, Angular provides a broad suite of tools, APIs, and libraries to simplify and streamline your development workflow. Angular offers you a solid platform on which to build fast and reliable applications that scale with both your team size and your codebase.

## What you will learn

In this practical course, you will learn how to create a complete Angular application from scratch.
You'll learn how Angular implements basic features we find in any web application, how to:

- isolate some parts of your application in components
- display dynamic content
- capture user interactions and form data
- display content based on the url with the Angular Router
- query a REST API with HttpClient

## What you will NOT learn

This course is designed as an introduction to Angular, it will not cover all of the features of the framework.
It focuses on what you NEED for a basic web app (Routing, Forms, HTTP) rather than a complete guide of all existing features.

Some advanced aspects of Angular are not covered, such as:

- advanced Dependency Injection
- advanced RxJS patterns
- Server-side rendering
- Internationalization
- guards, interceptors, and resolvers

You'll more likley need to learn about some of them for enterprise applications (but not all of them!) but you can get started with the basics first.

## What you will build

You will build a simple Wedding planner application that will allow you to manage a list of tasks. You will be able to read, add, modify, and delete tasks.

## Who is this course for?

This course is for developers with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript who want to discover Angular.
