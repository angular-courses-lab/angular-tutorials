You can now access the **TaskForm** component by clicking the `Update` link.
This path includes a dynamic value to pass the **id** of the task to update.

The **TaskForm** component form is currently empty because it was created to add a new task and is therefore initialized as an empty form.

```typescript
// task-form.ts
task = {
  id: "",
  title: "",
  description: "",
};
```

Update it to use the form for both creating and updating a task.

## Retrieve task information to update with TaskService

Before getting the route identifier, let's prepare the logic to identify the task to update.
Since the task list is stored in **TaskService**, you'll add a new function to retrieve a task based on its **id**.
From this identifier, you'll get the task to fill the form.

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-service.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Add a function to retrieve a task by its identifier": 30-33}
    // task-service.ts
    import { Injectable, signal, WritableSignal } from "@angular/core";
    import { Task } from "./task.model";

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: "root",
    })
    export class TaskService {
      tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
        {
          title: "Task 1",
          description: "Description of task 1",
          createdAt: new Date(),
        },
        {
          title: "Task 2",
          description: "Description of task 2",
          createdAt: new Date(),
        },
      ]);

      addTask(task: Task): void {
        this.tasks.update((tasks) => {
          return [...tasks, {
          ...task,
          createdAt: new Date(),
        });
        });
      }

      getTask(id: string): Task {
        return this.tasks().find((task) => task.id === id)!;
      }
    }
   ```

</Steps>

## Get the task identifier from the route

The **id** is present in the route path, you need to retrieve it in the **TaskFormComponent**.
Use the **ActivatedRoute** service to get the **id** from the route.

This service provides access to information about the current route.
As you did with the **Router**, you'll inject it into the **TaskFormComponent** constructor.

### Hooks: Angular lifecycle

Until now, you've initialized class properties during their declaration.

For example, you initialized the **task** property with an empty object:

```typescript
task = {
  id: "",
  title: "",
  description: "",
};
```

You can't use such logic to initialize the **task** property with the task to update because this `id` isn't yet available when the Component class is created.

**Why?**

From creation to destruction, a component goes through several stages.
When creating the Component class, route information is not yet available.

To handle such a case, Angular provides lifecycle hooks.
Lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls in components and directives when it creates, changes, and destroys them.

One of the most used lifecycle hooks is **ngOnInit**, which is already present in all created components of the application.
This hook is called right after Angular has instantiated the Component class.
And at this point, the component is able to read route information.

Inside this hook, start by retrieving the route identifier and save it into a new variable called `id`.

```typescript
private id: string | null = null;

ngOnInit() {
    this.id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
}
```

**route.snapshot** is a static image of route information and exposes a **paramMap** property.

This **paramMap** is a map of required and optional parameters specific to the route, including the dynamic route path parameters.
The **get** method of the **paramMap** object allows us to retrieve the value of a parameter based on the name you used in the route path definition: **id**.

Then, you'll retrieve the task to update from the **TaskService** based on the **id** available in the route.

```typescript
private id: string | null = null;

ngOnInit() {
      this.id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
      this.form.patchValue(this.taskService.getTask(this.id));
  }
```

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  The **TaskFormComponent** is used for both creating and updating a task. You
  should test if the **id** is available in the route before retrieving the task
  to update. This will prevent an error when the **id** is not available in the
  route.
</NotificationCard>

```typescript
private id: string | null = null;

ngOnInit() {
      this.id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

      if (this.id) {
          this.form.patchValue(this.taskService.getTask(this.id));
      }
}
```
## Form validation

Form validation is the process of checking user input in a form to make sure it is complete and correct before allowing the form to be submitted. For example, you can require certain fields to be filled in or check that an email address is in the right format. Angular provides built-in tools to help you validate form input and display useful error messages to users

For example: `Validators.required` is a built-in Angular validator used in reactive forms to make a form field mandatory. When applied, the form control is considered invalid if it is empty, helping ensure users fill out required fields before submitting the form. `Validators.minLength(3)` is another built-in Angular validator that checks if the input value has a minimum length of 3 characters. If the input is shorter, the form control is marked as invalid, prompting users to enter a longer value.

In our case we won't handle the error but we will console log the error if the form is invalid in our submit.



<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-form/task-form.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"add lifecycle onInit and get the id from the URL": 29-31} ins={"Retrieve the task identifier from the route": 32-36} ins={"inject ActivatedRoute": 22-23} ins={"import ActivatedRoute": 5-6} ins="implements OnInit" ins=" OnInit " ins={"create a variable for id as we need to reuse it": 24-25} ins="[Validators.required]" ins="[Validators.minLength(1)]"
   import {Component, inject, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
   import {FormControl, FormGroup, ReactiveFormsModule} from '@angular/forms';
   import {TaskService} from '../task-service';
   import {Router} from '@angular/router';

   import { ActivatedRoute } from "@angular/router";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-form",
     imports: [
     ReactiveFormsModule,
     ],
     templateUrl: "./task-form.html",
     styleUrl: "./task-form.css",
   })

   export class TaskForm implements OnInit {
     private taskService = inject(TaskService);
     private router = inject(Router);

     private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);

     private id: string | null = null;

     form = new FormGroup({
       title: new FormControl("", [Validators.required]),
       description: new FormControl("", [Validators.minLength(1)]),
     });

     ngOnInit() {
       this.id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get("id");

       if (this.id) {
         this.form.patchValue(this.taskService.getTask(this.id));
       }
     }

      submit() {
        if (this.form.invalid) {
          console.log('Your form is invalid. Please check the fields.');
          console.log('Your Form: ', this.form.value);
          console.log('Title Errors: ', this.form.controls.title.errors);
          console.log('Description Errors: ', this.form.controls.description.errors);
        }
        this.taskService.addTask(this.form.value);
        this.router.navigate(["/"]);
      }


   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Test it

<Steps>
  1. Click the `Update` button next to a task in the list. 2. The form should be
  filled with the task to update.
