## Current Situation

You have 2 components in your application: **TaskFormComponent** and **TaskListComponent**.
The **TaskFormComponent** is responsible for creating new tasks.
The **TaskListComponent** is responsible for displaying the list of tasks.

Creating a new task means adding it to the task list.
However, **TaskFormComponent** and **TaskListComponent** are not connected for now.

We need a third party to manage the items and share them between the two components.
This is where Angular services come in!

## Angular Services

In Angular, a service is a class that can be used to share data and functionality between different parts of your application.
Services are used to encapsulate logic that isn't directly related to a specific component.
This is our situation: tasks are not directly tied to either **TaskFormComponent** or **TaskListComponent** but are shared by both components.

For the rest of this course, Angular services will be our main orchestration tool for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks (CRUD).

The first objective will be to store the list to make it accessible from both components.

By default, Angular services are singletons, ensuring a single instance exists throughout the application. This allows the service to **retain** its state—such as stored data or variables—in memory, as long as the application remains active and is not refreshed.

Since Angular routing doesn't refresh the page, the service persists the task list in memory while navigating between **TaskFormComponent** and **TaskListComponent**.

## Creating a Service

To create a service in Angular, you can use the Angular CLI.
The `ng generate` command that you used for components can also be used to generate services.

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in a terminal:

   ```bash
   ng generate service task-service
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ng g s task-service
   ```

   This command will create a new file called `task-service.ts` in the `src/app` folder.

2. Open the `task-service.ts` file and add a Signal property to store the task list, and add following imports:

   ```typescript ins="uuid()" ins="WritableSignal" ins="signal" ins={"Import the task interface and the Signals related imports": 3-4} ins={"import uuid (id generator)": 6-7} ins={"Add the tasks variable": 14-28}
   // task-service.ts
   import { Injectable, WritableSignal, signal } from "@angular/core";

   import { Task } from "./models/task.model";


   import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })

   export class TaskService {

     tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ]);
   }
   ```

</Steps>

This list is exactly the same as the one we used in **TaskListComponent** to display the tasks.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  The line `import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";` imports the v4 function from the uuid library and renames it to uuid for easier usage in the code. The v4 function generates unique identifiers (UUIDs) based on random values, which are commonly used for creating unique IDs for objects like tasks.

<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  In this chapter, you learned how to create a service with Angular CLI.
  Services are used to share data and functionality between different parts of your application.
  Not only do they help keep your code maintainable by following the DRY principle ("Don't Repeat Yourself"), but they also help keep your components clean and focused on their main purpose.
