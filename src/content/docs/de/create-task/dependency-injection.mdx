## Remove the tasks list from TaskListComponent

The **TaskListComponent** class is still using its own tasks list.
You need it to use the service's list instead. The first step is to remove the tasks list from the **TaskListComponent** class.

<NotificationCard state="warning" title="Warning">
  As you remove this list, the application will stop working (it won't compile)
  temporarily because the HTML Template is still expecting a **tasks** variable.
</NotificationCard>

<Steps>

1. Remove the **tasks** variable from the `src/app/task-list.ts` file, and all imports related to it.

   ```typescript del="signal" del="WritableSignal" del="import { Task } from "./models/task.model";" del="import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";" del={"Remove the tasks list": 12-27}
   // task-list.ts

    import { Component, WritableSignal, signal } from "@angular/core";
    import { Task } from "./models/task.model";
    import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.css"],
   })

   export class TaskList {

     tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ]);
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Inject TaskService

Your **TaskListComponent** class needs to use **TaskService** to get the tasks list.
Angular uses the dependency injection system to provide **TaskService** to the **TaskListComponent** class.

The **TaskService** class is prefixed with the **@Injectable()** decorator.
A decorator is a special syntax in TypeScript used to attach metadata to a class, method, or property (You already saw it in the component file: **@Component()** ).
The **@Injectable()** decorator tells Angular that the **TaskService** class can be injected into other classes.

This is achieved by referencing the **TaskService** class in the **TaskListComponent** class constructor by using the `inject` function.

```ts
private taskService = inject(TaskService);
```

Your application compiles again and you can now use the **taskService** variable `tasks` to access the tasks list and initialize a local variable with the tasks list.

```ts
tasks = this.taskService.tasks;
```

1. Update the `src/app/task-list.ts` file.

```typescript ins={"Import TaskService": 3-4} ins={"Create a tasks variable and initialize it with TaskService's list": 14-15} ins={"Inject TaskService in the class constructor": 12-13}
// task-list.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

import { TaskService } from "../task-service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-task-list",
  templateUrl: "./task-list.html",
  styleUrls: ["./task-list.cponent.css"],
})
export class TaskList {

  private taskService = inject(TaskService);

  tasks = this.taskService.tasks;
}
```

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  Initializing a local variable with the tasks list allows the component to manage and display the tasks independently, ensuring better control over the data within the component's scope.
</NotificationCard>


<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  You have learned how to inject a service into a component using Angular's
  dependency injection system. It makes your service accessible in the component
  and allows you to use the service's methods and properties.
