## HTML Structure

To display an array of elements, the expected HTML structure is:

```html
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Follow the course</td>
      <td>05/24/2024</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Follow the course</td>
      <td>05/24/2024</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

  class="shadow-xl rounded-xl"
  src={staticImg}
  alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."
/>

However, what happens if you want to display a dynamic array of elements that changes over time?
What if a new task is added?

You'll want to rely on the **tasks** variable to display the correct list of tasks.
If the tasks are updated, the view (HTML Template) should be updated as well.

## Angular Control Flow

Introduced in Angular v17 and stable since v18, the new Control flow feature is the modern way in Angular to define rules for rendering HTML dynamically.
It somehow replicates the Javascript behavior at using `if`, `for` loops and `switch` statements in your templates.
Like in Javascript, we want some content to be either:

- displayed based on a condition **(if)**
- iterated over with a loop **(for)**
- displayed if matching a certain criteria **(switch)**

For the current lesson, we will use `@for` in the HTML template to iterate over the list of tasks.
It's made of 2 parts:

- the `@for` keyword with a definition of the list to iterate over and some options
- a block of code to execute for each item in the list

```html ins="// Loop Definition" ins="// Loop Body"
// Loop Definition @for (task of tasks; track task.id) { // Loop Body
<tr>
  <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
  <td>{{ task.createdAt }}</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>

}
```

### Loop definition

Like in Javascript we need to define 2 things:

- the list to iterate over
- a reference to use the value of each list item (you can name it whatever you want)

In our case, we want to iterate over the list of tasks we defined in our `component.ts` file and use the value of each task in the loop.
The expected format is `<reference> of <list>`.

```html
@for (task of tasks)
```

Angular also expects a `track` option to help it optimize the rendering of the list.
In our case, we will use the `id` of the task to track it.

```html
@for (task of tasks; track task.id)
```

If any rerendering of the list is needed, Angular will use the `id` of the task to determine if it's the same task or a new one.
If that's the same, Angular will reuse the existing DOM element rather than creating a new one.

### Loop body

The loop body is the code that will be executed for each item in the list.
Like in Javascript, we use `{}` to define the body of the loop.

```html
@for (task of tasks; track task.id) {
<tr>
  <td>Follow the course</td>
  <td>05/24/2024</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
}
```

#### Signals value

Rather than defining a simple property, we made it a `Signal` ealier: to get the value of a Signal, we need to call it with `()`, like `tasks()`.

```html ins="tasks()"
@for (task of tasks(); track task.id) {
<tr>
  <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
  <td>{{ task.createdAt }}</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
}
```

Let's now use this in our application.

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-list.html` file.

   ```html
   // task-list.html
   <table class="table">
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th scope="col">Name</th>
         <th scope="col">Date</th>
         <th scope="col">Actions</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       @for (task of tasks(); track task.id) {
       <tr>
         <td>Follow the course</td>
         <td>05/24/2024</td>
         <td></td>
       </tr>
       }
     </tbody>
   </table>
   ```

2. Go back to your browser and check the following page:

</Steps>

Your list is now displayed in the browser.
You should see `Task` repeated as many times (2) as there are tasks in the list.

  In this chapter, you discovered one feature from the Angular control flow, to
  iterate over a list of elements and display them in the HTML template. That's
  a quite common task as most of data used in applications is dynamic and
  changes over time.
