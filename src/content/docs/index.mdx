This tutorial is part of the **angular.courses** initiative - a community-driven effort to create comprehensive, hands-on learning experiences for Angular developers of all skill levels. Our mission is to provide practical, real-world tutorials that bridge the gap between Angular concepts and actual application development.

Through this initiative, we're building a collection of interactive tutorials that cover everything from basic Angular concepts to advanced patterns, helping developers master Angular through guided, project-based learning.
