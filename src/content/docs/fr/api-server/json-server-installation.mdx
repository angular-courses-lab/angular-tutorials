## What is JSON server?

json-server is a small package that helps you create a no-code API in less than 30 seconds.
It's a complete fake API with no code that allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

This won't provide us with a real API server, but it's an excellent tool to focus on the Angular part of the application.

Let's install it and create a fake database.

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in a terminal to install json-server.

   ```bash
   npm install json-server
   ```

2. Create a `db.json` file at the root of the project and fill it with a list of tasks.

   ```json
   {
     "tasks": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "First task",
         "description": "This is the first task in your to-do list.",
         "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00"
       },
       {
         "id": 2,
         "title": "Second task",
         "description": "This is the second task in your to-do list.",
         "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Create a `start-server` script in your `package.json` file.

   ```json ins={"Add start-server script": 3-4}
   {
     "scripts": {

       "start-server": "json-server --watch db.json"
     // other scripts...
     }
   }
   ```

4. Run the following command to start json-server.

   ```bash
   npm run start-server
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.

  In this chapter, you learned how to add json-server and configure it to create
  a fake API server. It will be used in the upcoming chapters to create, read,
  update, and delete tasks as if you were interacting with a real API server.
