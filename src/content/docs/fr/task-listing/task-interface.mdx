## Creating Interfaces

You will create a new TypeScript interface to represent a task.
Each task has 4 properties:

- **id**: a string representing the unique identifier of the task
- **title**: a string representing the title of the task
- **description**: a string representing the description of the task
- **createdAt**: a date representing the creation date of the task

<NotificationCard state="warning" title="Warning">
  We use interfaces to represent our entities and also the business models of
  the project. These business models and entities are therefore quite different
  from the component model as our `app.ts`.
</NotificationCard>

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Create a new folder called **models** in the `src/app` folder to store all TypeScript interfaces for the application.

    ```diff
    src
    └─ app
    +    └─ models
    ```


1. Create a new file called `task.model.ts` in this new folder.

    ```diff
    src
    └─ app
        └─ models
    +         └─ task.model.ts
    ```

1. Add the following code to the file:

   ```typescript
   // task.model.ts
   export interface Task {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     createdAt: Date;
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Generating Identifiers

You will generate a unique identifier for each task. This identifier will help you uniquely find a given task.
Such an identifier is typically generated by a backend server, but for this tutorial, you will generate it on the client side.

For this, you will use the **uuid** library. This library generates unique identifiers based on the current timestamp and a random number.

<Steps>

1. Install the **uuid** library by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install uuid && npm i --save-dev @types/uuid
    ```

</Steps>

## Using the Interface

A local variable will be created in the **TaskList** component to store a list of tasks.
You will use the **Task** interface to define the type of the tasks variable.

In JavaScript, you would define the tasks variable like this:

```javascript
tasks = [
  {
    title: "Task 1",
    description: "Description of task 1",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: "Task 2",
    description: "Description of task 2",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
];
```

To assign a type to a variable in TypeScript, you can use the `:` operator followed by the variable type:

```typescript ins=": Task[]"
tasks: Task[] = [
  {
    title: "Task 1",
    description: "Description of task 1",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: "Task 2",
    description: "Description of task 2",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
];
```

### Signals

Angular now use a new reactive API called **Signals**. It helps updating your application whenever a change occurs.

To make a property reactive with Signals, use the `signal` function and pass it the task list as a parameter.
Its type change too: as we want to be able to update the task list, we need to use the `WritableSignal` type.

```typescript ins="WritableSignal<Task[]>" ins="signal(" ins="]);"
tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
  {
    title: "Task 1",
    description: "Description of task 1",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: "Task 2",
    description: "Description of task 2",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
]);
```

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-list.ts` file:

    ```typescript ins={"Import signal APIs": 1} ins=", signal, WritableSignal" ins={"Import the task interface": 6-7} ins={"Import the uuid package": 9-10} ins={"Add the tasks variable": 18-32}
    // task-list.ts

    // Import the signal API
    import { Component, signal, WritableSignal } from "@angular/core";


    import { Task } from "../models/task.model";


    import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

    @Component({
      selector: "app-task-list",
      imports: [],
      templateUrl: "./task-list.html",
      styleUrls: ["./task-list.css"],
    })
    export class TaskList {

      tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
        {
          id: uuid(),
          title: "Task 1",
          description: "Description of task 1",
          createdAt: new Date(),
        },
        {
          id: uuid(),
          title: "Task 2",
          description: "Description of task 2",
          createdAt: new Date(),
        },
      ]);
    }
    ```
