# Create a reusable component

There is nothing specific to reusable components, you can create them like any other component.

But as their usage is meant to be *shared* across multiple components, that's a good opportunity to organize them in a dedicated folder.

## Create the folder

Common practice is to create a new folder in the `src/app` folder called `shared`.

Inside this folder, create a new folder called `components`.
This is where you'll put all your reusable components.

## Create the component

So far `ng generate` commands were runned at the root of the project.
By doing so, Angular generates new files directly in `src/app` folder, where the Angular application is located.

But as we'll create components in the `shared` folder, we need to run the command from there.

There are three ways to do that:

##### Change the current working directory in your terminal

- firstly changing the current working directory to `src/app/shared/components`
- then running the `ng generate component` command

```bash
cd src/app/shared/components
ng generate component alert-banner
```

##### Use the `--path` flag

```bash
ng generate component alert-banner --path=src/app/shared/components
```

##### prefix the component name

```bash
ng generate component shared/components/alert-banner
```
