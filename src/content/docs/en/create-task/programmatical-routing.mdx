In the last step, you tested the form with this scenario:

1. Click on the `Add a new task` link
2. Enter a title and description in the form
3. Click on the `Submit` button
4. Click on the `Task List` link

But what if we want to redirect the user to the task list after submitting the form?
This is a common scenario in web applications, and Angular provides a way to do it.

You've seen how to trigger navigation by clicking a link with the **routerLink** directive.
But in this situation, you'll trigger navigation when the **submit** function is called. In order to redirect the user to the task list.

## Inject the Router

Your own custom services aren't the only things you can inject into a component's constructor.
Using the Angular Router functionality, you can inject the **Router** service into a component.

This service allows you to retrieve information about the current route and enables you to navigate to a different route.

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-form.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"1. Import the Router": 4-5} ins={"2. Inject the Router": 13-14} ins={"3. Use the navigation function provided by the Router": 29-30}
   // task-form.ts
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { TaskService } from "../task-service";

   import { Router } from "@angular/router";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-form",
     // ...
   })
   export class TaskForm {
    private taskService = inject(TaskService);

    private router = inject(Router);

     task = {
       title: "",
       description: "",
     };

     submit() {
       this.taskService.addTask(this.task);

       this.router.navigate(["/"]);
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

The navigation function expects an array of route segments as a parameter.
In our case, you'll navigate to the **tasks** route as defined in your route configuration. Therefore, you pass `['/']`.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: "", component: TaskList },
  { path: "add-task", component: TaskForm },
];
```

## Test it

Now, if you repeat the previous scenario:

<Steps>

1. Click on the `Add a new task` link

2. Enter a title and description in the form

3. Click on the `Submit` button

</Steps>

You should be redirected to the task list.

  In this chapter, you learned how to use programmatic routing in an Angular
  application. You learned how to inject the **Router** service into a component
  and use its **navigate** function to navigate to a different route.
