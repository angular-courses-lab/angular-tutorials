  Add a basic HTML form to the task form component.
</NotificationCard>

## Form Structure

To create a form in HTML, you need to use the `<form>` tag.

The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.

The form can contain input elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

The form to create a task will have the following fields:

- Task title
- Task description

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Task model">
  The **Task** interface includes 2 additional properties: **id** and
  **createdAt**. Their values will be generated later when the form is submitted
  by the application and not by the user.
</NotificationCard>

---

The form also includes a submit button to create the new task based on the form values.

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-form/task-form.html`.

   ```html
   <form class="flex flex-col gap-2 m-auto">
     <fieldset class="fieldset w-full">
       <legend class="fieldset-legend">Name</legend>
       <input type="text" class="input w-full" placeholder="Type here" />
     </fieldset>

     <fieldset class="fieldset">
       <legend class="fieldset-legend">Description</legend>
       <textarea
         class="textarea w-full h-24"
         placeholder="Description"
       ></textarea>
     </fieldset>

     <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

</Steps>
