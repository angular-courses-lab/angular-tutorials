  Add a router outlet in the template to display the content of the current route

## Router-outlet directive

The **Router** API provides a directive called `router-outlet`.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Angular directives">
  Angular Directives are components without a template.
  There are meant to bind logic to your templates.
  In this situation, the router-outlet directive will dynamically display components based on the current URL
</NotificationCard>


Routed content will be displayed. When the user navigates to a different route, the content of the `router-outlet` is replaced with the content of the new route.
The `router-outlet` directive's only role is to mark the location in the HTML Template.  At this location, the content corresponding to the URL you defined will be displayed.

A directive is a component without a template. Like a component, it can be used in the HTML Template with its selector (like `<router-outlet>`), but it doesn't have a template.
It's meant to encapsulate a logic that can be used in the HTML Template.

Think of it as salt on food - when you sprinkle it (apply the directive), it enhances the flavor of the dish (changes the element's behavior), but you don't see the salt as a separate ingredient on your plate. It blends in while making everything work better.

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app.html` file to include the `router-outlet` directive:

   ```html ins={"Add the directive via the router-outlet tag to mark the location of the content configured via URL": 5-6}
   <div class="navbar bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
     <a class="btn btn-ghost text-xl">Task Manager</a>
   </div>
   <main class="m-12">

     <router-outlet />
   </main>
   ```

  2. Then add it to `src/app/app.ts` to the `imports` array of the **@Component** decorator of the app.ts file:

     ```ts del={"Remove TaskList imports as it's not needed anymore": 4-5} del="TaskList" ins="RouterOutlet" ins={"add RouterOutlet import": 2-3}
      import { Component } from '@angular/core';

     import {RouterOutlet} from '@angular/router';

     import {TaskList} from './task-list/task-list';

     @Component({
         // ...
         imports: [TaskList, RouterOutlet],
         })
           export class App {
         }
     ```
</Steps>

In the above case, the `router-outlet` is placed between the `<main>` tags. This means that you will continue to display the `<header>` on top of all pages. Only the content inside the main tag will be replaced by the content of the route.
