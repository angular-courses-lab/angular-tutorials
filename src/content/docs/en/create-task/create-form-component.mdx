## Creating Components

##### Instructions

<Steps>
1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    ng generate component task-form
    ```
    or the short version

    ```bash
    ng g c task-form
    ```

2. You should see a new folder called **task-form** in the `src/app` directory.

   ```diff
   src
   └─ app
       └─ task-form
   +       └─ task-form.ts
   +       └─ task-form.html
   +       └─ task-form.css
   ```

</Steps>

## Angular CLI Options

The Angular CLI provides several options to customize the component generation process.
You can add these options when running the previous command. For example, to avoid generating a component in a new folder, you can run the following command:

```bash
ng generate component task-form --flat
```

or the short version:

```bash
ng g c task-form --flat
```

If you want certain options to be set by default for all components, you can add them to the `angular.json` file located at the root of your project.

For the current project, we have already defined the following option:

```json
"@schematics/angular:component": {
  "skipTests": true
},
```

This avoids creating test files to reduce the complexity of the current tutorial.
The option was added to the `angular.json` file when we created the project with the Angular CLI.

  This tutorial doesn't cover knowledge about testing. This will be an important
  topic to master later.
</NotificationCard>

<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  You used the Angular CLI to create a new component. This is the second
  component you've created in this project. Such an action is common in Angular
  development, and the Angular CLI makes this process easier and more efficient.
  If needed, you can customize the component generation process with Angular CLI
  options.
