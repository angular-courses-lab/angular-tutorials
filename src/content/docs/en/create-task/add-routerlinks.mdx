## Add links to navigate between routes

You need to add links to trigger navigation between different routes.
You could manually modify the URL in the browser, but users expect to have clickable links to navigate between pages.

The HTML `<a>` tag is used to create links and is associated with the **routerLink** directive to use Angular routing. This directive takes the path of the route to navigate to as a value.

<Steps>

1. Import **RouterLink in the `src/app/app.ts` file.

   ```ts ins={"Add Routerlink import":3-4} ins={"Add Routerlink to the component imports":8-9} ins=", RouterLink"
   // app.ts
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";

   import { RouterLink, RouterOutlet } from "@angular/router";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-root",

     imports: [RouterOutlet, RouterLink],
     // ...
   })
   export class App {
   }
   ```

2. Define links in the `src/app/app.html` file.

    ```html  ins={"Add links to navigate between routes": 3-7}
    <div class="navbar bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
      <a class="btn btn-ghost text-xl">Task Manager</a>

      <ul class="menu menu-horizontal px-1">
        <li><a routerLink="/">Task List</a></li>
        <li><a routerLink="/add-task">Add new task</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <main class="m-12  max-w-screen-md mx-auto">
      <router-outlet />
    </main>
    ```

3. Click on both links to see the content of `TaskList` and `TaskForm` displayed alternately at the location defined by the `router-outlet`.

</Steps>

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  The path of the **TaskFormComponent** is defined as `add-task` in the
  `app.routes.ts` file. However, in the HTML Template, in the
  **routerLink** directive, it is specified as `/add-task` (with the `/`).

**routerLink** builds the URL relative to the current path. Adding a slash indicates that the URL should be built from the base URL of the application (here `http://localhost:4200`). Without specifying the slash in the **routerLink** directive, you would create nesting and navigate to `/add-task/add-task`.

> `<a routerLink="/add-task">...</a>` => http://localhost:4200/add-task

> `<a routerLink="add-task">...</a>` => http://localhost:4200/add-task/add-task
