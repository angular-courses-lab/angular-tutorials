## Define routes

To display the desired content based on the URL, you need to add a `path` to each of your `components` in your `routes` array, for example:

```typescript
{ path: 'add-task', component: TaskForm }
```

The path is therefore the URL that the user will access. For example, the path `/add-task` means that the user will navigate to the URL `http://localhost:4200/add-task`.

The provided component is the component that will be displayed in the `router-outlet` placeholder when the user accesses this URL.

The route definition resides in the `app.routes.ts` file.

    ```bash ins="app.routes.ts"
    src
    └─ app
        └─ app.routes.ts
    ```

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app.routes.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import components for each route": 3-5} ins={"Define the routes": 7-11}
   // app-route.ts
   import { Routes } from "@angular/router";

   import { TaskList } from "./task-list/task-list";
   import { TaskForm } from "./task-form/task-form";


   export const routes: Routes = [
     { path: "", component: TaskList },
     { path: "add-task", component: TaskForm },
   ];
   ```
