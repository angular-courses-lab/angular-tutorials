## What is routing?

Routing is the process of determining what content to display based on the browser's URL.
Angular is a Single Page Application (SPA) framework, handling URL changes within the application with JavaScript, not reloading the whole page on each new navigation, thanks to its router API.

The project currently only displays the **TaskList** component in your browser.
The Router will enable switching between this component and the new **TaskFormComponent**.

The Router API is provided by the `@angular/forms` package. It's installed in any new Angular project by default and you can find it in the `package.json` file.

We need three parts to implement routing:

- a list of routes to define the content displayed for a given URL
- a marker to decide where to display the content
- a link to trigger the navigation

## Router-outlet directive

The **Router** API provides a directive called `router-outlet`. Routed content will be displayed. When the user navigates to a different route, the content of the `router-outlet` is replaced with the content of the new route.
The `router-outlet` directive's only role is to mark the location in the HTML Template.  At this location, the content corresponding to the URL you defined will be displayed.

A directive is a component without a template. Like a component, it can be used in the HTML Template with its selector (like `<router-outlet>`), but it doesn't have a template.
It's meant to encapsulate a logic that can be used in the HTML Template.

Think of it as salt on food - when you sprinkle it (apply the directive), it enhances the flavor of the dish (changes the element's behavior), but you don't see the salt as a separate ingredient on your plate. It blends in while making everything work better.

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app.html` file to include the `router-outlet` directive:

   ```html ins={"Add the directive via the router-outlet tag to mark the location of the content configured via URL": 5-6}
   <div class="navbar bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
     <a class="btn btn-ghost text-xl">Task Manager</a>
   </div>
   <main class="m-12">

     <router-outlet />
   </main>
   ```

  2. Then add it to `src/app/app.ts` to the `imports` array of the **@Component** decorator of the app.ts file:

     ```ts del={"Remove TaskList imports as it's not needed anymore": 4-5} del="TaskList" ins="RouterOutlet" ins={"add RouterOutlet import": 2-3}
      import { Component } from '@angular/core';

     import {RouterOutlet} from '@angular/router';

     import {TaskList} from './task-list/task-list';

     @Component({
         // ...
         imports: [TaskList, RouterOutlet],
         })
           export class App {
         }
     ```
</Steps>

In the above case, the `router-outlet` is placed between the `<main>` tags. This means that you will continue to display the `<header>` on top of all pages. Only the content inside the main tag will be replaced by the content of the route.


## Define routes

To display the desired content based on the URL, you need to add a `path` to each of your `components` in your `routes` array, for example:

```typescript
{ path: 'add-task', component: TaskForm }
```

The path is therefore the URL that the user will access. For example, the path `/add-task` means that the user will navigate to the URL `http://localhost:4200/add-task`.

The provided component is the component that will be displayed in the `router-outlet` placeholder when the user accesses this URL.

The route definition resides in the `app.routes.ts` file.

    ```bash ins="app.routes.ts"
    src
    └─ app
        └─ app.routes.ts
    ```

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app.routes.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import components for each route": 3-5} ins={"Define the routes": 7-11}
   // app-route.ts
   import { Routes } from "@angular/router";

   import { TaskList } from "./task-list/task-list";
   import { TaskForm } from "./task-form/task-form";


   export const routes: Routes = [
     { path: "", component: TaskList },
     { path: "add-task", component: TaskForm },
   ];
   ```

</Steps>

## Add links to navigate between routes

You need to add links to trigger navigation between different routes.
You could manually modify the URL in the browser, but users expect to have clickable links to navigate between pages.

The HTML `<a>` tag is used to create links and is associated with the **routerLink** directive to use Angular routing. This directive takes the path of the route to navigate to as a value.

<Steps>

1. Import **RouterLink in the `src/app/app.ts` file.

   ```ts ins={"Add Routerlink import":3-4} ins={"Add Routerlink to the component imports":8-9} ins=", RouterLink"
   // app.ts
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";

   import { RouterLink, RouterOutlet } from "@angular/router";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-root",

     imports: [RouterOutlet, RouterLink],
     // ...
   })
   export class App {
   }
   ```

2. Define links in the `src/app/app.html` file.

    ```html  ins={"Add links to navigate between routes": 3-7}
    <div class="navbar bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
      <a class="btn btn-ghost text-xl">Task Manager</a>

      <ul class="menu menu-horizontal px-1">
        <li><a routerLink="/">Task List</a></li>
        <li><a routerLink="/add-task">Add new task</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <main class="m-12  max-w-screen-md mx-auto">
      <router-outlet />
    </main>
    ```

3. Click on both links to see the content of `TaskList` and `TaskForm` displayed alternately at the location defined by the `router-outlet`.

</Steps>

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  The path of the **TaskFormComponent** is defined as `add-task` in the
  `app.routes.ts` file. However, in the HTML Template, in the
  **routerLink** directive, it is specified as `/add-task` (with the `/`).

**routerLink** builds the URL relative to the current path. Adding a slash indicates that the URL should be built from the base URL of the application (here `http://localhost:4200`). Without specifying the slash in the **routerLink** directive, you would create nesting and navigate to `/add-task/add-task`.

> `<a routerLink="/add-task">...</a>` => http://localhost:4200/add-task

> `<a routerLink="add-task">...</a>` => http://localhost:4200/add-task/add-task
