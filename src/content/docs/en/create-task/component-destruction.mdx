When you submit the form, the **task** property of **TaskForm** is populated with the values you entered in the form.
For example, given that you filled in the name and description fields, the **task** property will be:

```typescript
form = new FormGroup({
  title: new FormControl(''),
  description: new FormControl('')
});
```

By submitting the form and navigating to a new page, you also leave the **TaskForm**.
When you leave a component, it is destroyed.

Thus, when navigating back to this form, the form will be initialized with empty values:

```typescript
form = new FormGroup({
  title: new FormControl(''),
  description: new FormControl('')
});
```

A new instance of the **TaskForm** is created each time you access it.
Therefore, any local state you define in the component is lost when you navigate to another route.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  This is why you use the **TaskService** to store the new task. The service is
  a singleton, meaning it's a unique instance shared across the application.
  Unless you force the application to reload in the browser, the tasks you've
  added will be preserved.

<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  In this chapter, you learned about the Angular component lifecycle and how
  local state is reset when a component is destroyed and recreated. You also
  learned why services are used to persist data across navigation.
