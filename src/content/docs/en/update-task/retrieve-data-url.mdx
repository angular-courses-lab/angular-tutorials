  Retrieve data from the URL in Angular
</NotificationCard>

You can now access the **TaskForm** component by clicking the `Update` link.
This path includes a dynamic value to pass the **id** of the task to update.

The **TaskForm** component form is currently empty because it was created to add a new task and is therefore initialized as an empty form.

Let's update it to use the form for both creating and updating a task.

## Retrieve task information to update with TaskService

Before getting the route identifier, let's prepare the logic to identify the task to update.
Since the task list is stored in **TaskService**, you'll add a new function to retrieve a task based on its **id**.
From this identifier, you'll get the task to fill the form.

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-service.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Add a function to retrieve a task by its identifier": 30-33}
    // task-service.ts
    import { Injectable, signal, WritableSignal } from "@angular/core";
    import { Task } from "./task.model";

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: "root",
    })
    export class TaskService {
      tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
        {
          title: "Task 1",
          description: "Description of task 1",
          createdAt: new Date(),
        },
        {
          title: "Task 2",
          description: "Description of task 2",
          createdAt: new Date(),
        },
      ]);

      addTask(task: Task): void {
        this.tasks.update((tasks) => {
          return [...tasks, {
          ...task,
          createdAt: new Date(),
        });
        });
      }

      getTask(id: string): Task {
        return this.tasks().find((task) => task.id === id)!;
      }
    }
   ```

</Steps>

## Get the task identifier from the route

The **id** is present in the route path, you need to retrieve it in the **TaskForm** component.
Use the **ActivatedRoute** service to get the **id** from the route.

This service provides access to information about the current route.
As you did with the **Router**, you'll inject it into the **TaskForm** component.

```typescript
private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);

private id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
```

**route.snapshot** is a static image of route information and exposes a **paramMap** property.

This **paramMap** is a map of required and optional parameters specific to the route, including the dynamic route path parameters.
The **get** method of the **paramMap** object allows us to retrieve the value of a parameter based on the name you used in the route path definition: **id**.

Then, you'll retrieve the task to update from the **TaskService** based on the **id** available in the route.

```typescript
private id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

constructor() {
  this.form.patchValue(this.taskService.getTask(this.id));
}
```

:::caution
This `id`variable is not a Signal, though not 'reactive'.
It's fine for two reasons:

- it gets its value at the Component creation, it does not change over time
- it's not used in the template, so ever if it happens to change, it won't be reflected in the template

If you feel like having to choose between a Signal and a regular variable is complicated, you are safe at using a Signal.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  The **TaskForm** component is used for both creating and updating a task. You
  should test if the **id** is available in the route before retrieving the task
  to update. This will prevent an error when the **id** is not available in the
  route.
</NotificationCard>

```typescript
private id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

constructor() {
  if (this.id) {
    this.form.patchValue(this.taskService.getTask(this.id));
  }
}
```

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-form/task-form.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"get the id from the URL": 19-20} ins={"Patch the form value": 28-31} ins={"inject ActivatedRoute": 17-18} ins={"import ActivatedRoute": 5-6}
   import { Component, inject, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
   import { FormControl, FormGroup, ReactiveFormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
   import { TaskService } from "../task-service";
   import { Router } from "@angular/router";

   import { ActivatedRoute } from "@angular/router";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-form",
     imports: [ReactiveFormsModule],
     templateUrl: "./task-form.html",
     styleUrl: "./task-form.css",
   })
   export class TaskForm implements OnInit {
     private taskService = inject(TaskService);
     private router = inject(Router);

     private route = inject(ActivatedRoute);

     private id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get("id");

     form = new FormGroup({
       title: new FormControl("", [Validators.required]),
       description: new FormControl("", [Validators.minLength(1)]),
     });

     constructor() {

       if (this.id) {
         this.form.patchValue(this.taskService.getTask(this.id));
       }
     }
   }
   ```
