The point of this step is to introduce you with the solutions to update the value of a reactive form.
A reactive form is a set of classes you use, in our situation, initialized as so:

```typescript
form = new FormGroup({
  title: new FormControl(""),
  description: new FormControl(""),
});
```

To update it, you can't juste set it a value directly, like `form = {title: "New Title", description: "New Description"}` because it's not a regular object.

The Reactive Forms API provides you with two methods to update the value of a reactive form:

- `setValue()` sets all form control values at once and requires you to provide values for every form control - if you miss any, it throws an error.

- `patchValue()` updates some or all form controls and ignores missing properties - it only updates the controls that match.

:::note
Use `setValue()` to completely replace all form values, use `patchValue()` for partial updates.

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `TaskForm` class:

   ```typescript ins={"Add the preFillForm function": 3-9}
   // task.form.ts


   preFillForm() {
       this.form.setValue({
         title: 'Generated Task',
         description: 'Generated Description',
       });
   }
   ```

</Steps>

With `setValue()` if you miss any, it throws an error. Use it when you want to completely replace all form values.
