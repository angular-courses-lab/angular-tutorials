  Learn how to use Signals to make your application reactive.
</NotificationCard>

### Signals

Angular now use a new reactive API called **Signals**. It helps updating your application whenever a change occurs.

To make a property reactive with Signals, use the `signal` function and pass it the task list as a parameter.
Its type change too: as we want to be able to update the task list, we need to use the `WritableSignal` type.

```typescript ins="WritableSignal<Task[]>" ins="signal(" ins="]);"
tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
  {
    title: "Task 1",
    description: "Description of task 1",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: "Task 2",
    description: "Description of task 2",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
]);
```

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-list.ts` file:

   ```typescript ins={"Import signal APIs": 1} ins=", signal, WritableSignal" ins={"Import the task interface": 6-7} ins={"Import the uuid package": 9-10} ins={"Add the tasks variable": 18-32}
   // task-list.ts

   // Import the signal API
   import { Component, signal, WritableSignal } from "@angular/core";

   import { Task } from "../models/task.model";

   import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     imports: [],
     templateUrl: "./task-list.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.css"],
   })
   export class TaskList {
     tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ]);
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Why use Signals?

Signals are meant to be used for reactivity purposes. If this variable will be static for the first part of the tutorial, it'll accept changes later on and we already want it to be reactive.

Except if you use some old project, your application should use Angular 21 or higher.
This version introduces what we call **zoneless change detection**. The _change detection_ is the solution to detect changes in your application to update your templates accordingly.
With zoneless change detection, the change detection is triggered automatically when a signal is updated, while it's not for other variables.

  You have learned how to create your first TypeScript interface. This will help
  during this course to track errors and improve code quality. You have also
  learned how to use the TypeScript interface to define a variable type.
