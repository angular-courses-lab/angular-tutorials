Components are the UI building blocks of Angular applications.
They help organize an application into smaller, reusable elements for a more maintainable codebase.

Components can be used to fulfill one or more of the following purposes:

- Break down the application into smaller components;
- Reuse the same component in different parts of the application;
- Dedicate their content to a route with their own URL.

Enterprise applications are made up of many components. Each component is an element of the application that controls a part of the screen.

  If you are familiar with **components** concepts in another framework, it's
  about the same with Angular.

## Your First Component

Your project already has a default component called `App`. It consists of 3 files found in the `src/app` folder:

```bash ins="app.ts" ins="app.html" ins="app.css"
src
└─ app
    └─ app.ts
    └─ app.html
    └─ app.css
```

Each of these files is a key part of the component:

- `app.ts`: The component class code written in TypeScript;
- `app.html`: The component Template written in HTML;
- `app.css`: The CSS styles dedicated to the component.

Think of the human body:

- The HTML file represents the bones: it's the structure;
- The TypeScript file represents the brain and muscles: it's the logic;
- The CSS file is the person's appearance: it'll look handsome if you're good at it!

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  There is often a misunderstanding about the term Template. The HTML file is
  the HTML Template of your component. It represents the **view** of your
  component. The TypeScript file represents the model of your component.
