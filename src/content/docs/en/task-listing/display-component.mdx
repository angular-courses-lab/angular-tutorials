  Learn how to display the component's HTML template in the application.
</NotificationCard>


So far, the application only displays the HTML content of the **App** component in the browser.
You've generated the new component but it's still unused as Angular does no know where to use it: you need to use its selector `app-task-list` to display its HTML template.

As its selector is not a valid native HTML tag like `<button>`, we need to explain Angular its origin, otherwise it will display an error message:

```
✘ [ERROR] NG8001: 'app-task-list' is not a known element:
1. If 'app-task-list' is an Angular component, then verify that it is included in the '@Component.imports' of this component.
2. If 'app-task-list' is a Web Component then add 'CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA' to the '@Component.schemas' of this component to suppress this message. [plugin angular-compiler]

    src/app/app.html:5:0:
      5 │ <app-task-list/>
        ╵ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Error occurs in the template of component App.

    src/app/app.ts:7:15:
      7 │   templateUrl: './app.html',
        ╵                ~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

To do this, you need to import the component in the `app.ts` file to get its reference:

```diff lang="ts"
// app.ts
+ import { TaskList } from './task-list/task-list';
```

Then add it to the `imports` array of the **@Component** decorator for the component to understand it's part of its context:

```ts ins="TaskList"
// app.ts
@Component({
  // ...
  imports: [TaskList],
})
export class App {}
```

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `template`property of the `app.ts` file as follows:

   ```ts ins={"import the TaskList component": 4-5} ins={"Add the TaskList component to the App component imports": 9-10}
   // app.ts
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { RouterOutlet } from "@angular/router";

   import { TaskList } from "./task-list/task-list";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-root",

     imports: [RouterOutlet, TaskList],
     templateUrl: "./app.html",
     stylesUrl: ["./app.css"],
   })
   export class App {
     protected title = "angular-introduction-course";
   }
   ```

2. Update the `app.html` file to display the `task-list` component:

   ```html ins={"Add the component selector, and the <main> tag (semantic/styles)": 4-7}
   <div class="navbar bg-base-100 shadow-sm">
     <a class="btn btn-ghost text-xl">Task Manager</a>
   </div>

   <main class="m-12 max-w-screen-md mx-auto">
     <app-task-list />
   </main>
   ```

3. Check the changes in your browser.

   <Image
     class="shadow-xl rounded-xl"
     src={creationImg}
     alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."
   />

</Steps>

  `task-list works!` appears in the browser. This is the default content
  generated by the Angular CLI in the component's HTML Template. You will update
  it in the upcoming lessons.

<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  In this chapter, you learned how to create a new component using the Angular
  CLI and use it in your application. You also remembered that the component's{" "}
  <strong>view</strong> is its HTML Template and the component's{" "}
  <strong>model</strong> is its TypeScript file.
