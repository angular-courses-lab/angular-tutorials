  Learn how to define a Task interface in Angular.
</NotificationCard>

## Creating Interfaces

You will create a new TypeScript interface to represent a task.
Each task has 4 properties:

- **id**: a string representing the unique identifier of the task
- **title**: a string representing the title of the task
- **description**: a string representing the description of the task
- **createdAt**: a date representing the creation date of the task

<NotificationCard state="warning" title="Warning">
  We use interfaces to represent our entities and also the business models of
  the project. These business models and entities are therefore quite different
  from the component model as our `app.ts`.
</NotificationCard>

##### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Create a new folder called **models** in the `src/app` folder to store all TypeScript interfaces for the application.

   ```diff
   src
   └─ app
   +    └─ models
   ```

1. Create a new file called `task.model.ts` in this new folder.

   ```diff
   src
   └─ app
       └─ models
   +         └─ task.model.ts
   ```

1. Add the following code to the file:

   ```typescript
   // task.model.ts
   export interface Task {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     createdAt: Date;
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Generating Identifiers

You will generate a unique identifier for each task. This identifier will help you uniquely find a given task.
Such an identifier is typically generated by a backend server, but for this tutorial, you will generate it on the client side.

For this, you will use the **uuid** library. This library generates unique identifiers based on the current timestamp and a random number.

<Steps>

1. Install the **uuid** library by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install uuid && npm i --save-dev @types/uuid
   ```

</Steps>

## Using the Interface

A local variable will be created in the **TaskList** component to store a list of tasks.
You will use the **Task** interface to define the type of the tasks variable.

In JavaScript, you would define the tasks variable like this:

```javascript
tasks = [
  {
    title: "Task 1",
    description: "Description of task 1",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: "Task 2",
    description: "Description of task 2",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
];
```

To assign a type to a variable in TypeScript, you can use the `:` operator followed by the variable type:

```typescript ins=": Task[]"
tasks: Task[] = [
  {
    title: "Task 1",
    description: "Description of task 1",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: "Task 2",
    description: "Description of task 2",
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
];
```

  The variable won't be added it to your code, as we'll firstly introduce a new
  concept in the next step.

<NotificationCard state="success" title="What you've learned">
  You have learned how to create your first TypeScript interface. This will help
  during this course to track errors and improve code quality. You have also
  learned how to use the TypeScript interface to define a variable type.
