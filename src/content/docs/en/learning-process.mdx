## Course Structure

The course is divided into several chapters, each focusing on a specific application feature.
The course is feature-driven rather than technology-driven: Angular features will be introduced when needed in the context of a new feature in the application.

It keeps you focus at learning something you can use right away, with a real application.

## Chapters

#### Display a list

<span class="text-sm text-gray-400 block pl-4">
  Learn how to build the foundation of your application by creating a task list.
  You'll create a component to display tasks, use Angular control flow to render
  lists dynamically, and apply styling for a clean UI.
</span>

#### Handle forms and navigation

<span class="text-sm text-gray-400 block pl-4">
  Create a form component for adding new tasks. Use the Angular CLI to generate
  components, build and style forms, and collect user input with Angular's form
  handling. Navigation is introduced to enable switching the content on screen.
</span>

#### Use forms to update existing data

<span class="text-sm text-gray-400 block pl-4">
  Adapt a form for editing tasks, pre-fill form fields with existing data,
  handle validation, and use Angular's routing and lifecycle hooks to update
  task information.
</span>

#### Consolidate your knowledge

<span class="text-sm text-gray-400 block pl-4">
  Add delete functionality to your task list. Implement a delete button, connect
  your UI to Angular services, and manage state as users remove tasks.
</span>

#### Create reusable components

<span class="text-sm text-gray-400 block pl-4">
  Create reusable components for your application. Use Angular's component
  architecture to build reusable UI elements, and learn about component communication with a
  parent-child relationship.
</span>

#### Communicate with an API

<span class="text-sm text-gray-400 block pl-4">
  Integrate your Angular app with an external API using <code>HttpClient</code>.
  Retrieve, create, update, and delete tasks from a backend server, and learn
  about observables and the async pipe.
</span>

## Lessons

Each chapter is divided into several lessons. Each lesson is a small action to accomplish.
Each lesson is introduced with a learning objective and a description of the expected outcome.

##### Instructions

After a brief explanation of the technical aspects, a lesson will provide you with a set of instructions to update the code, for example:

<Steps>

1. Create the **Task** model in the `src/app/models` folder.

   ```typescript
   // src/app/models/task.model.ts
   export class Task {
     id: number;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     completed: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. Create a new component named **TaskFormComponent**.

</Steps>

#### Terminal

Some lessons will ask you to run commands in the terminal.

In Visual Studio Code, you can open a terminal by clicking on the `Terminal` menu and selecting `New Terminal`.

#### Code Snippets

Most lessons contain code snippets as examples to help you accomplish the action.
The course content uses a specific style to highlight code changes, for example:

```html ins={"Add the event binding to create the task": 11-14} ins="(click)="createTask()""
// task-form.html
<form>
  <label for="title" class="form-label">Title:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="title"
    name="title"
    class="form-control"
    [(ngModel)]="task.title"
  />

  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" (click)="createTask()">
    Create Task
  </button>
</form>
```
