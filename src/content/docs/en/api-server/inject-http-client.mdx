  Learn how to inject HTTP Client into your Angular application.
</NotificationCard>

The **HttpClient** service is a built-in Angular service that allows you to send HTTP requests to a server.
As we already did with some services such as **ActivatedRoute** or **Router$$, we could inject it in a component.

But that's a common bad practice to inject services in components!
We want to keep oyur components as clean as possible, not to focus on the business logic, but on the UI.
That's why we'll inject the **HttpClient** service in the **TaskService** service, not in a component.

<Steps>

1. Inject the HttpClient service in the `src/app/task-service.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import the HttpClient service": 2-3} ins={"Inject the HttpClient service": 9-11}
   import { Injectable, inject } from "@angular/core";

   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {

     private http = inject(HttpClient);
   }
   ```

</Steps>

  <strong>HttpClient</strong> is a built-in Angular service that allows you to
  send HTTP requests to a server. It's one of the first modules added to a real
  Angular application to communicate with a server. In the next chapters, we'll
  use it to communicate with the mock API server to retrieve and update tasks.
