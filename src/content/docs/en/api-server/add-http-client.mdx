## HttpClient Provider

The HttpClient is a built-in Angular service that allows you to send HTTP requests to a server.

<Steps>

1. Inject the HttpClient service in the `src/app/task-service.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import the HttpClient service": 2-3} ins={"Inject the HttpClient service": 9-11}
   import { Injectable, inject } from "@angular/core";

   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {

     private http = inject(HttpClient);
   }
   ```

</Steps>

  <strong>HttpClient</strong> is a built-in Angular service that allows you to
  send HTTP requests to a server. It's one of the first modules added to a real
  Angular application to communicate with a server. In the next chapters, we'll
  use it to communicate with the mock API server to retrieve and update tasks.
