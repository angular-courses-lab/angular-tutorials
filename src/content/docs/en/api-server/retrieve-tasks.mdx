## Update TaskService

The **HttpClient** service exposes several functions that allow you to make HTTP requests to a server. In this chapter, you'll use the **get** method to retrieve the task list from the API server.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  **get** refers to **GET** requests in the HTTP protocol.
</NotificationCard>

This function takes the API server route path as a parameter: `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.
This is the URL it will query to get the list of tasks.

```typescript
getTasks(): Observable<Task[]> {
  return this.http.get<Task[]>('http://localhost:3000/tasks');
}
```

This new **getTasks** method defines the communication with the API server:

- It makes a **GET** request;
- It expects an array of **Task** objects in response;
- It communicates with the API server at the URL `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.

<NotificationCard state="warning" title="Warning">
  The API will be responsible for retrieving the task list and you won't need
  the **tasks** variable in **TaskService** anymore. However, since some code
  still depends on this variable, you'll need to keep it for now.
</NotificationCard>

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-service.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Add the getTasks function": 24-27}
   import { Injectable, signal, WritableSignal } from "@angular/core";
   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
   import { Task } from "./task.model";
   import { Observable } from "rxjs";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     private http = inject(HttpClient);

     tasks: WritableSignal<Task[]> = signal([
       {
         id: "1",
         title: "First task",
         description: "This is the first task in your to-do list.",
       },
       {
         id: "2",
         title: "Second task",
         description: "This is the second task in your to-do list.",
       },
     ]);

     getTasks(): Observable<Task[]> {
       return this.http.get<Task[]>("http://localhost:3000/tasks");
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Update TaskList

Update **TaskList** to use the new **getTasks** method and rename the **tasks** variable to **tasks$**. Adding `$` indicates that it's an Observable.

```typescript
tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();
```

Why? What is an observable?

**tasks** was an array of **Task** objects. Now, **tasks$** is an observable of an array of **Task** objects.

By calling the **getTasks** function, we get an Observable that will emit the list of tasks once received from the API server.
To differentiate an observable value, the Angular community commonly uses the `$` suffix in Angular applications.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  An Observable **observes** a data stream.
</NotificationCard>

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-list/task-list.ts`.

   ```typescript del={"Remove the tasks variable": 12-13} ins={"Replace it with the tasks$ variable": 14-15}
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { TaskService } from "../task-service";
   import { Task } from "../task.model";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.html",
     styleUrl: "./task-list.css",
   })
   export class TaskList {
     private taskService = inject(TaskService);

     tasks = this.taskService.tasks;

     tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Subscription

Calling the **getTasks** function won't trigger the API request immediately. Since it hasn't been triggered yet, the observable won't emit any values.
Trigger what we call a subscription to the observable to start the request.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  You **subscribe** to an observable like you would subscribe to a newspaper.
  You request the latest issue of the newspaper. Only once it's available, it's
  delivered to you and you can read it.
</NotificationCard>

### How to subscribe?

There are several ways to subscribe to an observable.
For the given situation, use the **async** pipe in the HTML Template.

Like the **date** pipe used previously, the role of the **async** pipe is to transform data before displaying it.
Here its role will be to subscribe to the observable and return the list of tasks once available.

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  Although alternatives exist, the **async** pipe is the recommended way to
  subscribe to an observable in the HTML Template. You'll discover the
  alternative at the end of this page.
</NotificationCard>

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-list/task-list.html` file.

   ```html ins="tasks$ | async"
   @for (task of tasks$ | async; track task.id ) {
   <tr>
     <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
     <td>{{ task.createdAt | date}}</td>
     <td>
       <a class="btn btn-secondary m-1" [routerLink]="['/update', task.id]"
         >Update</a
       >
       <button
         class="btn btn-danger m-1"
         type="button"
         (click)="deleteTask(task.id)"
       >
         Delete
       </button>
     </td>
   </tr>
   }
   ```
