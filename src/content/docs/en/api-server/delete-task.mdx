      <p>
        Delete a task from the list by making an API call to the mock server.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

## TaskService

Based on the HTTP protocol, you will use the **delete** function to remove a task from the list: **http.delete()**.
This function expects only one parameter, the URL of the resource to delete, including the **id** of the task to remove.

```typescript
deleteTask(id: string) {
    return this.http.delete<Task>(`http://localhost:3000/tasks/${id}`);
}
```

<Steps>

1. Update the **task-service.ts** file.

   ```typescript ins={"Add the deleteTask function": 10-16}
   import { Injectable, inject } from "@angular/core";
   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
   import { Task } from "./task.model";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     private http = inject(HttpClient);

     deleteTask(id: string) {
       return this.http.delete<Task>(`http://localhost:3000/tasks/${id}`);
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## TaskForm

Update **TaskForm** to use this new function.
The simplest way to do this would be to apply the same logic as in the previous lesson, updating the **submit** function to make an API call and navigate to the list page.
This would result in the following code:

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-list/task-list.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Modify the deleteTask function": 13-18}
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { TaskService } from "../task-service";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.css"],
   })
   export class TaskList {
     private taskService = inject(TaskService);

     tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();

     deleteTask(id: string): void {
       this.taskService.deleteTask(id).subscribe(() => {
         document.location.reload();
       });
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

<NotificationCard state="info" title="Note">
  `document.location.reload();`
  This is not best practice, but for simplicity we reload the page. In best practice, you would update the local state (signal or component data) by filtering out the deleted task from the current tasks array, avoiding the need to reload the entire page and providing a better user experience.
</NotificationCard>

Following the same logic seen previously, we will wait for the request response to refresh the task list view.
